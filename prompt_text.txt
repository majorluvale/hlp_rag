Humanitarian Reset 
Cluster Simplification: Interim Messages to Country Operations
Published Date
16 September 2025
1. Purpose
The purpose of this update is to inform HCs and HCTs about decisions taken regarding cluster simpliﬁcation, with a focus on decisions regarding the integration of clusters and implications for the 2026 Humanitarian Programme Cycle (HPC).
It is acknowledged that there will be a transition phase for some of these adjustments to take full effect at country level. Decisions on lead accountabilities for integrated global clusters speciﬁcally are expected to be communicated by early October 2025.
Other critical dimensions of cluster simpliﬁcation, including greater integration and support to area-based coordination, will continue to be worked on globally beyond October 2025, in close coordination with operations.
2. Decisions to date
In March 2025 and as part of the wider Humanitarian Reset, the ERC asked the Co-Chairs of the IASC Operational Policy and Advocacy Group (OPAG) for recommendations on simplifying the cluster system. Following a consultative process at both global and local level, the following was agreed, in addition to other recommendations:
At global level:
Global structures will be reduced from 11 clusters and 4 Areas of Responsibility (AoR) to 8, as follows:
Joint CCCM, Shelter and HLP Cluster (Shelter/NFI; Camp Coordination and Camp Management; and Housing, Land and Property AoR to integrate, with ﬁnal cluster name and scope to be determined);
Protection Cluster (with Gender-Based Violence (GBV), Mine Action (MA), and Child Protection (CP) AoRs fully integrated);
Logistics and Telecommunications Cluster (Emergency Telecommunications and Logistics to integrate);
the Global Cluster for Early Recovery will transform into a mechanism supporting transition and linkages with the development system;
ﬁve global clusters (Education, Food Security, Health, Nutrition, and WASH) remain as are for the moment.
Note: Cluster Lead Agencies (CLAs) for clusters and AoRs which will integrate at global level are currently reviewing work modalities and lead accountabilities which are expected to be communicated by early October 2025.
At country level:
As per wider Humanitarian Reset ambitions to empower local leadership and decision-making, and building on existing guidance, HCs/HCTs should ensure that country-level coordination structures, including clusters, are ﬁt for context and co-coordinated by local responders (local/national civil society actors or authorities), including women-led organizations (WLOs), wherever feasible and duly upholding humanitarian principles.
HCs and HCTs can determine the conﬁguration of clusters at country level, including which clusters to (de-)activate and/or group, in consultation with relevant authorities and in line with humanitarian principles as well as capacities in-country. This offers a modular system based on speciﬁc contexts and the prevalence of needs, crisis complexity, and capacity of national/local responders.
3. Preliminary implications for country-level application
While different clusters are currently activated across countries, HCs and HCTs are encouraged to prepare for aligning with consolidated/integrated structures at global level to ensure predictability. HCs and HCTs, in consultation with global clusters and CLAs, may consider transitioning towards fewer activated clusters, including possible consolidations, in line with context-speciﬁc needs and priorities.
Lessons learned and insights at country-level during this process will continuously feed into global discussions on structural and work arrangements.
As operational footprints di􀀁er across contexts, HC/HCTs will be required to facilitate pragmatic decisions on local CLA arrangements, as informed by operational capacity and in discussion with organizations which have technical expertise and are able to meet country-level accountabilities, including Provider of Last Resort (PoLR) functions. Global CLAs and global cluster coordinators should ensure timely and effective support to the country-level CLA and country-level cluster coordinators.
Any country-level adjustments to cluster coordination arrangements should be informed by capacity, predictability, and accountability considerations related to cluster responsibilities and cluster core functions, and should be consulted with global clusters.
Cluster co-coordination by local and national actors, including WLOs, should be supported to become the default, wherever feasible and aligned with humanitarian principles. This should be enabled through adequate resourcing, including via pooled funds and capacity-strengthening supported by international actors, as well as more equitable risk sharing. As capacities and complexity across operations vary signiﬁcantly, international NGOs will continue to play a critical role in cluster co-coordination and for supporting the responsible transfer of related responsibilities to local/national civil society actors.
HCs and HCTs should ensure transition planning towards national/locally-led coordination and response, which may entail de-activation of clusters. Periodic in-country coordination reviews and annual operations review by the Emergency Directors Group (EDG) can be used for decisions on whether to operationally initiate such transitions.
Changes to cluster (de-)activation or CLA arrangements continue to require the endorsement by the EDG, as delegated by the IASC Principals.
HC/HCTs are encouraged to co-locate cluster coordinators and establish dotted reporting lines from cluster coordinators to HCs to foster integrated, multisectoral planning and delivery and enhance response readiness.
4. Implications for the 2026 HPC at country level
Global clusters and Cluster Lead Agencies are, collectively, fully committed to driving forward the decisions taken through the Humanitarian Reset on cluster simpliﬁcation. Currently, Cluster integrations are at different stages globally and at country-level, and this has implications for how concerned clusters will be reﬂected in the HPC 2026.
To that end – and acknowledging feedback from global cluster coordinators and CLAs regarding what is, and is not, technically feasible and responsible for the HPC 2026 – the following way forward is proposed:
Protection Cluster:
Cluster to have one consolidated chapter in the HPC 2026 template, with the chapter to include the following data and visuals:
PIN, severity and target for the entire cluster
funding needs for the cluster and breakdown per AoR (CP, GBV, MA, and HLP (until its integration with CCCM/Shelter))
PIN, severity and target per AoR will be included in the narrative.
Protection Cluster coordinators to work with AoR coordinators for CP, GBV, and MA in each context to ensure inclusion of CP, GBV, and MA in the chapter narrative. HLP to be included under Protection for HPC 2026 (unless and until integration in the new cluster with Shelter/CCCM is formalized at country and/or global-level).
Logistics and Telecommunications Cluster: it is envisaged that there will be one chapter for the HPC 2026 at country-level, which will also include UNHAS.
Shelter, CCCM and HLP: given that discussions are ongoing regarding the scope of work and technical approach for the integrated Cluster, Shelter and CCCM will be presented separately for the HPC 2026, except where an integrated cluster exists at country-level, in which case the HPC should follow the coordination structure and present the integrated cluster as one. HLP will be included under Protection for the HPC 2026.
In addition, the HPC 2026 template will include a page where country operations can outline their vision and progress towards implementation of the Humanitarian Reset, thereby reassuring audiences of the continued ambition and trajectory in 2026, and amongst others allowing an explanation (if needed) regarding how cluster integrations are progressing.

HLP AoR memo: 
Maintaining Momentum and Focus on Housing, Land and Property (HLP) through the humanitarian reset:
Partnerships for protection, homes, land and shelter
The ongoing 'humanitarian reset' includes plans to change the cluster coordination system, including an end of the four Areas of Responsibility within the Global Protection Cluster. This includes Housing, Land and Property. As of July 2025 the Shelter, CCCM and HLP clusters/AoR have been asked to form a new ‘Land and Shelter’ cluster (name as used in recent IASC communication, but still to be decided).
The HLP AoR is committed to an effective transition ensuring HLP is properly integrated in the new way of working as decided in the coming months. From consultations with HLP AoR colleagues, partners, coordinators it is clear that there are opportunities in this new formulation, and also risks that HLP issues - especially those rooted in protection - could be lost, or less visible in the future arrangements. Early conversations with Shelter and CCCM colleagues have been very positive., We need to be clear and focused to ensure the right breadth of HLP issues and approaches are included for the best possible outcome for affected people. 
This note gathers critical HLP issues to be part of this new cluster and ways of working. In particular the HLP AoR imagines a strong continuing connection with the protection cluster[1].
--

The HLP AoR and its members are committed to ensure the scope of HLP activities remains comprehensive and technically robust. Sustained attention is needed on critical issues such as women’s access to land, inheritance rights, and eviction prevention and response, to create an enabling environment for all people, and especially the most vulnerable and marginalised, to access and enjoy their HLP rights.
The HLP AoR and its members are committed to ensure an effective HLP humanitarian response in line with the IASC six + one core functions as part of the new cluster. There are many practical elements of how this cluster will operate, though the following HLP issues and ways of working should be included to ensure effective, sustainable and dignified outcomes for affected people.
This is a moment to further develop and deepen the integration of HLP activities and issues into the work of shelter and CCCM partners. At the same time there are areas outside of the immediate current scope of shelter and CCCM practitioners that must be maintained in this new cluster. Broadly speaking these fall into the following areas:
Legal assistance – counselling, awareness, ADR, negotiation, inheritance, strategic litigation
Policy development re HLP rights – links to HLP in durable solutions i.e. restitution, climate changes and other evolving areas
Advocacy – rights based and linked to policy development and role of local authorities.
HLP technical and thematic areas to be included within the scope of the new arrangements[2] 
Assessment and analysis of HLP context, including formal and customary legal and normative frameworks, consideration of gender, livelihoods, conflict-sensitivity, HLP rights, etc[3] .
HLP due diligence[4] - identify land for humanitarian infrastructure, understand land tenure arrangements for site selection, ensure humanitarian programmes respect land and housing rights. This will minimise risk of doing harm, prevent evictions, promote long term tenure security and contribute to durable solutions.
Support reasonable due diligence, streamlined within Shelter, CCCM, WASH, food security, Mine Action, etc.
Also, frame due diligence as a strategic investment. “Due diligence secures donor and community investments in reconstruction.”  Due diligence is an essential risk mitigation tool that safeguards the sustainability and impact of aid investments and a service across clusters and sectors.  
Further integrated work with Shelter and CCCM clusters and partners, especially to increase security of tenure. Collaborative working across these areas ensures effective and durable shelter/cccm interventions.  
HLP to be included as an imperative part of recovery and reconstruction, with clear links to humanitarian response.
Forced evictions – monitoring and responding to risks/threats of eviction (prevention, mitigation); responding to evictions. This includes for people in camp and camp-like settings and all shelter environments. This is a critical issue as eviction can lead to further displacement and exposure to protection risks. 
Support to restitution processes and the resolutions of land disputes – local, alternative mechanisms and access to justice.
Continued support for legal reform processes, strengthening land governance mechanisms, and advocacy efforts.
Documentation safeguarding (within humanitarian response), including awareness raising and likely liaison with local authorities. These processes should be contextually relevant and sensitive, built on careful analysis and not limited to formal documentation and land administration structures.
Returns, local integration or relocation can cause HLP related challenges - for example, secondary occupation, social tension and/or conflict. Need for alternative dispute resolution approaches and tools (ADR, mediation, negotiation etc).
Increasing women’s access to HLP rights (including analysis of gender and HLP)
Where relevant, HLP and natural resources, livelihoods, links to climate change and readiness. In the context of humanitarian response this will mean collaborating and coordinating with relevant disaster preparedness and risk reduction actors, including authorities.
Ways of working, Principles for approaching HLP in the new cluster and in service to others:
HLP in the coordination architecture:
HLP expert agency/global HLP focal point to be part of leadership of the new cluster to ensure focus, collaboration, harmonisation, structured learning, investment across sectors/clusters, and to act as a liaison with donors, member states and other partners.
HLP steering group (or similar) made up of key HLP actors (eg. global/regional focal points, specialists etc). This group can support strategic engagement with HLP issues through the cluster.
Ensure continued collaboration with the Protection Cluster (see below)..
Role of HLP leadership in new cluster:
Reinforce localisation, with national and sub-national co-coordination by local actors.
Promote training for coordination, dialogue, facilitation – soft/life skills
Consolidate and develop training, guidance and tools on HLP
Enhance local actors’ HLP related capacities concerning but not limited to: deliver HLP services (including legal advice),  fundraise and manage HLP related projects,  advocate for HLP and influence local duty-bearers in design and implementation of HLP related policies.
Maintain a formal HLP coordination function at national and sub-national levels - process for partners to request technical HLP coordination and ensure platform for it to happen (eg as a TWG, WG or similar)
Maintain specialist HLP IM capacity
Address resource disparity – map available resources on HLP and coordination and ensure appropriate capacity wherever possible.
Integrating HLP within shelter, site management and in support of other clusters:
Preserve and enhance the role of HLP as a technical service provider to other clusters/sectors and actors working on response aspects connected to land, housing and/or property. This includes development of relevant guidance and tools.
Maintain and deepen connection with the protection cluster and partners, including on protection risks, monitoring and aligned indicators and analytical approaches, wherever possible.
Information Management and Analysis
For information and evidence-based decision making, the ‘new’ cluster must integrate substantive HLP information management and analysis capacity/function. Much progress has been made since 2023, and this momentum must be maintained to ensure we know what are the key gaps on HLP issues to address for durable and dignified solutions. This has included collaboration with shelter and CCCM cluster IMOs and shelter specialists at REACH and Impact Initiatives.
Specifically:
Support to countries on HLP IM and analysis
HPC - maintain link with HLP issues related to protection
Develop integrated approach to IM with shelter, cccm partners
Shelter cluster has its own approach to HLP issues – map,  consolidate and integrate.
Link between HLP and protection clusters and ways of working – eg protection risks.
Monitoring and responding to risks of forced eviction
Continue discussions - mapping common services, how to work/split work with different Ims
Structure support - eg regional Information Management (IM) for Central and West Africa (CWA) etc.
Naming the new cluster:
It is not yet decided what the new shelter/cccm/HLP cluster will be called. The name will reflect the focus of the work, how it is seen by others and the visibility of those issues on which it works, so requires careful consideration.
Some initial suggestions include the following:
Homes, Land and Communities
Housing, Land and communities
Homes and Communities
Land and Shelter
Settlements
[END]


HLP aor, shelter cluster and cccm cluster created new cluster called Shelter, Land and Site Coordination cluster, SLSCC.

here are words from IASC

Global lead/accountability arrangements and work modalities:
 
● IFRC and IOM are the global Cluster Lead agencies for the new Global Shelter, Land, and Site Coordination (SLSC) Cluster. IFRC and IOM are jointly accountable to the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) as Global Provider of Last Resort (POLR) for the broader SLSC performance, with NRC retaining the Global POLR role on the Housing, Land and Property (HLP) thematic area. This new Global Cluster reflects one integrated global coordination platform bringing together the existing mandates and functions of Shelter, CCCM and HLP into a place-based, people-centred model, recognising that affected people live in diverse settings, camps, informal sites, host communities, urban or rural settlements, and require coherent cross-cutting support across these locations, including through area-based approaches. Both Global Lead Agencies are responsible for conflict and disaster contexts without distinction.
● The global structure is designed as one team acting collectively as an inter-agency platform with staffing and expertise drawn from multiple partners, reflecting the comparative and complementary strengths of Shelter, CCCM, and HLP functions. The Global SLSC Cluster leadership and working methods are grounded in the Principles of Partnership and equality, transparency and complementarity will be upheld notably through an inclusive Strategic Advisory Group (SAG), transparent decision making and shared analysis. The principles of predictability, accountability and flexibility will be core principles guiding the design and work of the cluster.
● The Cluster will enable accountable and efficient humanitarian responses across its different thematic areas through effective coordination, supporting resource mobilisation efforts, strengthening partner capacities, and ensuring protection i mainstreaming across diverse the operational contexts where it works. The cluster’s work will be guided by IASC policies on Accountability to Affected People (AAP), Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA), Prevention of Gender Based Violence (GBV) and the Centrality of Protection. 
● The Global SLSC Cluster will provide predictable, principled, and coordinated support to country operations, ensuring technically appropriate operational guidance and tools, consistent information management, access to technical expertise, and two-way engagement with national clusters. The structure will remain intentionally light and flexible, allowing efficiencies and adaptation as partner contributions, operational realities, and donor landscapes evolve.
 
2. Country-level arrangements and work modalities:
 
● In line with the Humanitarian Reset, Humanitarian Coordinators and HCTs will determine the most context-appropriate country-level coordination arrangements. The SLSC Cluster offers a coherent framework that can be merged, adapted, or modularised based on contextual realities.
● The HCT may activate the SLSC cluster when needed based on needs, operational capacity and crisis scale. For existing clusters, the decision to merge existing HLP AoRs, CCCM and Shelter clusters also rest with the HCT as appropriate to the context.
● At national level, the SLSC cluster is activated in agreement with the host government and is designed to support and, where possible, be co‑led by relevant government authorities, with clear planning from the outset for hand‑over and/ or transition.
● Local and national actors including women-led-organizations, should be co-leaders by default wherever feasible and aligned with humanitarian principles, with international CLAs supporting and enabling their leadership, including through resourcing, capacity strengthening, risk and decision-making sharing as recommended by the IASC Localization guidance. The Global SLSC Cluster will track leadership arrangements and measure actions taken to promote the meaningful participation and leadership of local and national actors.
● As capacities and complexity across operations vary signiﬁcantly, international NGOs will continue to play a critical role in cluster co-coordination and for supporting the responsible transfer of related responsibilities to local/national civil society actors.
● Sub‑national or time-bound thematic working groups may be maintained or created where useful, and transition planning with government and local actors should begin from the outset.
● At country level, leadership will rest with the agency or agencies best placed to do so, based on context, capacity, and available resources. Existing country-level CLA arrangements remain in place for the time being. Any adjustments to CLA arrangements will be determined by HCTs in line with the Humanitarian Reset and according to contextual needs.
 
3. Next steps to consider for implementation at country level, including to address anticipated challenges:
 
3a Global level priorities
 
● Develop the cluster’s integrated scope, including clarity on thematic visibility across CCCM, Shelter and HLP functions.
● Initiate transition planning with joint SAG arrangements bringing together Shelter, CCCM and HLP representatives.
● Align tools, IM systems and guidance to the new structure, ensuring operational data systems capture needs and services across the full range of SLSC functions.
● Provide clear guidance on thematic communication and establish flexible global support modalities including surge and remote support.
● Ensure consistent and coherent communications with partners, donors and authorities on the purpose, value, and structure of the SLSC Cluster, aligned with global guidance.
 
3b National level priorities
 
● For HCTs considering cluster mergers, provide a clear menu of coordination models for structuring SLSC functions and sharing high-level narrative on the cluster’s integrated scope.
● Support HCTs through any cluster transition and merger processes they may decide to initiate, ensuring continuation of coordination and accountability.
 
3 Localization
 
● Strengthen national and local co-leadership by identifying local co-coordinators early and providing predictable support and capacity-strengthening packages.
● Organise orientations for national counterparts on the cluster’s approach and structure
